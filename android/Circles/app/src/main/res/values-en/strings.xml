    <string name="main_small_instruction">Draw a circle!</string>

    <string name="pi_calculation_intro">The number &#x3c0; is the ratio between a circles perimeter and it\'s diameter. In Perfect Pi the goal is to draw a circle with that same ratio. Unfortunately this is impossible. To begin with &#x3c0; has an infinite amount of decimals so however close you get it\'s always possible to get even closer. There are also technical limitations. The display consists of pixels which form a grid. So all figures drawn are represented by patterns of horizontal and vertical lines which when zoomed out can be made to look like round shapes. But if you\'re really good and witty you can still get a value close to &#x3c0;.</string>
    <string name="pi_calculation_part1">The computations are based on the isoperimetric inequality. It says that for all closed curves the inequality 4&#x3c0;A ≤ L&#xb2; is true. This means that if you multiply a closed curve\'s area (A) with 4&#x3c0; the result will always be less or equal to the perimeter (L) squared.</string>
    <string name="pi_calculation_part2">By rewriting the isoperimetric inequality we end up with a relationship that can be used to compute the &#x3c0;-value for a curve (I).</string>
    <string name="pi_calculation_part3">When a user drags his finger on the display, data is collected. This data is made up of points in an array. Line segments are then created between every two following points (x<sub><small>i</small></sub>,y<sub><small>i</small></sub>) and (x<sub><small>i+1</small></sub>,y<sub><small>i+1</small></sub>). These lines represent the drawn figure. To find a figure which can be used in the calculations the list of line segments is searched for a point where two line segments intersect or meet. The two line segments and all line segments in between form a closed curve which can be used in the calculations. If no line segments intersect or meet a new line segment is created from the first point to the last.</string>
    <string name="pi_calculation_part4">Getting the length of the perimeter is easily done by adding the length of all the lines together. Calculating the area is a bit more tricky if you want a good result.</string>
    <string name="pi_calculation_part5">To calculate the area we use the following expression:</string>
    <string name="pi_calculation_part6">Finally the values are put into the isoperimetric inequality and out pops an incredibly accurate &#x3c0;-value for the drawn figure.</string>

    <string name="pi_fact_1">The number &#x3c0; is defined as the ratio of a circle\'s circumference to its diameter.</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_2">Pi is an irrational number, therefore it cannot be written as a fraction and it has an infinite decimal expansion. Two well-used approximations of pi are 3.14 and 22/7.</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_3"> "Pi-day" is celebrated on March the 14th which was chosen to resemble the approximation 3.14. Many people like to start the celebration around 1:59 pm which combined with the date resembles 3.14159, which is an even better approximation of pi.</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_4">Pi is used in astronomy and astrology to calculate paths and celestial bodies. Copernicus and Galileo used pi to approximate the size of the earth and the distance to the moon. An example on how pi is used in astronomy is when calculating the apparent brightness (intensity) of a star using the following formula:</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_5">Where I is the apparent brightness of the star in W/m²,  L is the luminosity of the star in  W,D is the distance to the star in meter.</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_6"> The worlds record for memorizing the value of pi was won by the Chinese Chao Lu, whom in 2005 memorized and recited the value up to the 67 890 first decimal places.</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_7"> Euler\'s identity is considered to be one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics and was discovered by Leonhard Euler in 1743. It assembles the five most fundamentals numbers in mathematics: 0, 1, the unit of imaginary numbers ´i´, the base of natural logarithm ´e´ and of course &#x3c0;.</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_8">Albert Einstein was born on pi-day, March the 14th 1879.</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_9">About 250 b.c. Archimedes calculated an approximation of pi by using an algorithm that consists of engraving a circle in between two polygons. By computing the circumference he found that the value of pi was between 223/71 and 22/7. Because of this pi is also called Archimedes constant.</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_10">If you write "3.14" on a piece of paper and hold it up to a mirror, it reflects the word "PIE".</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_11">Around year 1644 Pietro Mengoli posed what is called the Basel problem. The problem consisted of calculating the sum of the infinite series. This problem was solved by Leonhard Euler in 1743, who showed that:</string>
    <string name="pi_fact_intro">The number &#x3c0; has a several thousand year old story. Ever since the babylonians around 2000 b.c. estimated the value of pi to 25/8, mathematicians and civilizations have struggled and attempted to get a more precise value and today we have estimations of pi with several billions decimal places. We have collected some fun facts that we have encountered during the development of the app.</string>
